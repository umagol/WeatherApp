# Adobe Learning Manager - Certificate & Course Migration Guide
## Moving User Data Between Organizations (Source Account → Destination Account)

---

## **MIGRATION SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: User with Paid Certificates in Private Account → Move to Corporate Account**
**Example:** Employee has personal ALM account with purchased certificates, now joining a company and wants to transfer certificates to company account.

### **Scenario 2: User Moving Between Organizations**
**Example:** Employee changing companies wants to carry their learning history, certificates, and in-progress courses.

### **Scenario 3: User Consolidating Multiple Accounts**
**Example:** User has multiple ALM accounts (personal + previous employer) and wants to consolidate everything into current employer account.

### **Scenario 4: Account Type Change**
**Example:** User upgrading from free/trial account to paid corporate account and wants to preserve all progress.
